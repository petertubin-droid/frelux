-- ARCHIE ANATOMY — EARS GOES NATIVE (OPENAI REMOVED)
-- migration: 20260913120000_archie_ears_native.sql
--
-- Owner-directed OpenAI Separation Rule (2026-09-10):
-- "ARCHIE is independent — remove OpenAI from ARCHIE's
--  system. I have a voice bank in the database, use that
--  instead of OpenAI."
--
-- The ears subsystem no longer holds any provider dependency:
--   * Speech is understood through NATIVE on-device speech
--     recognition (browser/OS engine — no cloud provider,
--     no API key, no OpenAI).
--   * The owner's VOICE BANK (frelux_archie_voice_samples)
--     powers the voice machinery: replies are spoken with
--     the deterministic pitch/pace profile, and every
--     utterance gets an honest voice-print check (pure
--     pitch math against the bank profile).
--   * archie-ears is now the owner-gated, rate-limited,
--     audited INTAKE for native transcripts — it performs no
--     transcription and holds no provider key.
--   * A missing OpenAI key can no longer make ears
--     NOT_OPERATIONAL: it never depended on one.
