-- =========================================================
-- ARCHIE CORE PRINCIPLE — PROVIDER INDEPENDENCE
-- (OPENAI SEPARATION RULE) — PERMANENT, OWNER-DIRECTED
--
-- Seeds the OPENAI SEPARATION PRINCIPLE into ARCHIE's durable
-- birthright store, by direct owner instruction (2026-09-10):
--
--   "ARCHIE is independent — remove OpenAI from ARCHIE's
--    system. I have a voice bank in the database, use that
--    instead of OpenAI."
--
--   * ARCHIE's voice features are provider-free: replies are
--     spoken through the owner's own voice bank (deterministic
--     pitch/pace math on recorded samples — no cloud AI) and
--     speech is understood through native on-device speech
--     recognition. No OpenAI key, API or model powers any
--     part of ARCHIE's ears or voice.
--   * No OpenAI API endpoint, key, model id or SDK may appear
--     in any ARCHIE-owned function, module, page or test.
--   * A missing OpenAI key can never make an ARCHIE subsystem
--     fail or claim NOT_OPERATIONAL — ARCHIE does not depend
--     on it at all.
--   * OpenAI belongs ONLY to the FRELUX application as a
--     secondary fallback, under the same conditions as Gemini.
--
-- The seed is IDEMPOTENT and IMMUTABLE-BY-DESIGN (same
-- pattern as the Gemini separation rule):
--   * ON CONFLICT (principle_id) DO NOTHING — an upgrade,
--     migration or re-deploy NEVER overwrites or erases it.
--   * ARCHIE itself cannot alter the row (RLS, admins only).
--   * Encoded in core code at src/lib/archie/provider-independence.ts
--     and statically enforced by
--     src/lib/archie/__tests__/provider-independence.test.ts.
