-- =========================================================
-- ARCHIE ANATOMY — EARS BECOMES OPERATIONAL (REAL)
-- migration: 20260913100000_archie_ears_operational.sql
--
-- The Ears / Audio Intelligence subsystem is now genuinely
-- implemented, connected, tested and verified:
--
--   * REAL STT core: native-engine/ears.ts (OpenAI Whisper)
--   * Owner-only edge function: archie-ears (rate-limited,
--     fully audited to frelux_archie_audit_events)
--   * Client engine: src/lib/archie/ears.ts (explicit
--     owner-initiated mic capture, typed honest failures)
--   * Chat voice notes transcribed into the normal cognitive
--     pipeline; Voice page speaks replies via the voice bank
--   * 16 new tests lock in the never-fabricate invariants
--
-- The seed migration (20260910200000) honestly registered
-- ears operational=false with NO bindings because no real
-- transcription backend existed yet — never faked. This
-- migration binds it now that it is real. The anatomy
-- health runner independently verifies the engine module
-- loads and reports HEALTHY only once a real transcription
-- is audited — the registry row alone proves nothing.
