-- =========================================================
-- Phase 42: AI Construction Document Extraction records
--
-- Stores the structured data extracted by the
-- ai-construction-extraction edge function after the user
-- reviews it. This is extraction metadata only — quantities,
-- materials and costs are always computed by the deterministic
-- Build-to-Roof engine, never stored from AI output.
--
-- The original uploaded document stays on the user's device;
-- only file name, kind, and the user-confirmed structured data
-- are persisted (for signed-in users).
-- =========================================================
