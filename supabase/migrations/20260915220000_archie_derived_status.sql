-- =========================================================
-- ARCHIE PHASE 8 — DERIVED-VS-TAUGHT KNOWLEDGE SEPARATION
-- The fact store gains the 'derived' status: facts produced
-- by the forward chainer are stored as DERIVED knowledge —
-- they never auto-enter the validated KB (the old >= 0.6
-- confidence shortcut is gone), they are labeled as derived
-- in answers, and when they contradict owner-taught/seed
-- knowledge the DERIVED fact is parked (owner wins).
-- Promotion out of 'derived' still requires the real
-- verification-event gates in the engine.
