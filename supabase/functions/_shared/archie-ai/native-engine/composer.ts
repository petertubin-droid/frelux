// =========================================================
// RESPONSE COMPOSER (plan P6 — fluid, honest language)
// Deterministic discourse composition: the engine's answers
// keep their exact factual content (cited facts, confidence,
// provenance, epistemic labels) while the CONNECTIVE tissue
// — openings, footers, transitions — varies naturally.
//
// Hard rules:
//  1. Same content → same phrasing, byte-stable (stable hash
//     of the cited evidence picks the variant). Same input
//     always reads the same — never random.
//  2. Different content → different phrasing across a
//     request stream, so answers stop reading like stamps.
//  3. Every variant of a frame family preserves the required
//     epistemic marker ("validated knowledge", provenance,
//     confidence) — fluency NEVER trades away honesty.
//  4. Zero fabrication surface: the composer only frames
//     parts that already carry provenance; it invents no
//     facts, no numbers, no claims.
