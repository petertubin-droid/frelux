 * step regardless of what was asked. These operators use the
 * `$goal` subject: at plan() time the engine supplies the goal
 * subject DERIVED FROM THE REQUEST ("wedding reception",
 * "roofing project for my bungalow"), and the planner
 * substitutes it — so the chain is about what was actually
 * asked, and the dependency chain below is real means-ends

 *
 *   inventory → gaps → knowledge (owner-teach | research)
 *              → quantities (estimate | confirm) → sequence
 *              → draft → propose
 *
 * Every operator maps to a real ARCHIE subsystem (the engine
 * executes the bound ones and reports honest step results —
 * see engine.executePlanSteps). Consequential steps stop at
 * PROPOSE: execution stays owner-gated, permanently.
