// =========================================================
// ARCHIE NATIVE INTELLIGENCE ENGINE — SHARED CORE TYPES
// supabase/functions/_shared/archie-ai/native-engine/types.ts
//
// The foundational processing layer of ARCHIE's own native
// intelligence (owner directive: "BUILD ARCHIE'S OWN NATIVE
// INDEPENDENT INTELLIGENCE ENGINE AS A FOUNDATIONAL CORE
// COMPONENT"). Zero external AI APIs. Every subsystem here is
// REAL executable code with measurable capabilities — no
// mocks, no scripts, no placeholders. Where a capability is
// not yet implemented, it is reported honestly (see
// capabilities.ts) instead of faked.
//
// Permanent architecture:
//   ARCHIE NATIVE ENGINE → MEMORY → KNOWLEDGE → REASONING →
//   TOOLS → LEARNING → VERIFICATION → IMPROVEMENT
// =========================================================
