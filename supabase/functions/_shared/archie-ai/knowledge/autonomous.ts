// =========================================================
// ARCHIE AUTONOMOUS KNOWLEDGE PROMOTION
//
// Owner directive (2026-09-12):
//   "Knowledge accumulation should be free. ARCHIE should be
//    able to learn, filter and promote knowledge without my
//    review — but restricted from modifying its code and
//    decisions without my approval and authority. ARCHIE is
//    free to accept, process, filter and store or accumulate
//    knowledge on its own."
//
// This module is ARCHIE's autonomous promotion path. Material
// that passes the filters below is promoted into the ACTIVE
// knowledge layer with NO human review step. Everything is
// audited (frelux_learning_audit, action AUTONOMOUS_PROMOTION).
//
// Owner directive (2026-09-12, LEARNING AUTHORITY /
// EXECUTION AUTHORITY): ARCHIE has UNRESTRICTED authority to
// learn and accumulate knowledge from lawful, accessible
// sources. Owner authorization is NOT a gate for ordinary
// knowledge acquisition. Learning what to do and doing it
// are SEPARATE permissions:
//
//   LEARN FREELY -> UNDERSTAND -> REASON -> PLAN ->
//   AUTHORITY CHECK -> EXECUTE WHEN AUTHORIZED
//
//   * Knowledge acquisition is NEVER restricted because the
//     subject may eventually require authorization to act
//     upon (code, governance, security, execution, decisions
//     as SUBJECTS are free to learn).
//   * Learning authority is NEVER a mechanism for authority
//     escalation: ARCHIE may not freely expand its authority
//     to act.
//
// What still HOLDs for the owner (the AUTHORITY CHECK, applied
// to anything trying to enter the ACTIVE layer as an ACT
// rather than as understanding):
//   * EXECUTION-INTENT material — proposals whose purpose is
//     to perform an owner-controlled act (modify code, change
//     rules/config/policy, amend the constitution, delegate
//     authority, issue credentials, engage the killswitch,
//     override an owner decision).
//   * Deterministic certified math (the calculator rule
//     registry — painting, tiling, structural, ...) is a
//     DECISION surface, not free knowledge. Mirrors
//     MATH_CAPABILITIES in src/lib/learning/types.ts — if
//     either list changes, update the other (drift contract).
//   * Material quarantined by ingestion sanitization
//     (injection flags) still requires the owner.
