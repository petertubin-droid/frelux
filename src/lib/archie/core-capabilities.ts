// =========================================================
// FRELUX PHASE 8 FINAL, ARCHIE ↔ FRELUX CORE REGISTRY
//
// ARCHIE is not an isolated chatbot: it is wired to the real
// FRELUX application core. This registry binds every major
// capability to its REAL implementation module and its REAL
// exported entry functions, no simulated, placeholder or
// duplicate bindings. core-orchestrator verifies every
// binding by dynamically importing the actual module and
// confirming the exported functions exist, so a disconnected
// or renamed core function fails the health check loudly.
