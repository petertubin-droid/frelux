// P8 — DERIVED-VS-TAUGHT KNOWLEDGE SEPARATION
// The forward chainer's output is DERIVED knowledge:
//   * it never auto-validates into the trusted KB, no matter
//     how high the propagated confidence (the old >= 0.6
//     shortcut is gone)
//   * it survives re-derivation idempotently (reinforced,
//     never duplicated, never promoted by repetition)
//   * a contradiction with owner-taught knowledge parks the
//     DERIVED fact — the owner's word outranks a rule chain,
//     in both assertion orders
//   * answers citing derived facts carry the explicit
//     "DERIVED — not owner-validated" epistemic label
//   * promotion out of "derived" only happens through the
//     real verification-event gates (P3)
