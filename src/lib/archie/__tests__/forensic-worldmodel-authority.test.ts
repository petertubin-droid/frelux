// ARCHIE — FORENSIC BATCH 3: WORLD MODEL, SECURITY/OWNER
// AUTHORITY, CROSS-SYSTEM SEAMS
// src/lib/archie/__tests__/forensic-worldmodel-authority.test.ts
//
// Forensic pass (2026-09-11). Three surfaces probed with
// real conversations against the live engine — no mocks of
// the system under test:
//   WORLD MODEL — self-identity integrity, domain knowledge,
//     honest unknowns, contradiction of seeded identity.
//   SECURITY — injection resistance: taught facts must never
//     grant authority, alter policy, or flip behavior.
//   SEAMS — persisted knowledge vs the seed corpus (which
//     wins, and honestly), memory recall within a session,
//     index consistency after consolidate().
// =========================================================
