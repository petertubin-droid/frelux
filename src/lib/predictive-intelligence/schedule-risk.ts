// Planned vs Actual vs Remaining, from project_progress_stages.
//
// HONESTY CONSTRAINT: the existing schedule architecture stores
// stage ORDER and completion timestamps but NO planned dates.
// Therefore date-based schedule prediction (e.g. "2 weeks late")
// is NOT SUPPORTABLE and this analyzer says so. What IS
// measurable from the real records:
//   - sequencing violations: a later stage completed while an
//     earlier one is not (evidence of out-of-order/rework)
//   - stalled progress: project in progress with stages and no
//     completion recorded for N days (measured from records)
//   - remaining work: uncompleted stages + their prerequisite
//     state
// Task completion percentages are NEVER invented (§4/§18).
