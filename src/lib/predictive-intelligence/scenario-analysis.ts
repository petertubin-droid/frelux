// =========================================================
// FRELUX PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE — SCENARIO ANALYSIS (§11)
//
// Explicit what-if scenarios over REAL recorded baselines:
//   - "What if material prices increase 10%?"
//   - "What if this task is delayed by 7 days?"
//   - "What if I change this material?"
//
// Every scenario shows baseline → changed assumption → result →
// difference → assumptions. All arithmetic is deterministic.
// A scenario is ALWAYS labelled hypothetical — it is NOT a
// prediction and never presented as one (§11/§18).
//
// For engine-comparison scenarios (e.g. two designs), the Phase 2
// scenario-engine (compareScenarios) remains the authoritative
// path; this module covers project-level cost/what-if questions.
